# To-Do List For People who Struggle with Task Paralysis

This program will take a list of inputs (tasks that the user needs to do for the day) and show only one task at a time
to help combat task paralysis and executive disfunction. 

## Major Functions
- Can create saved lists which can be hard-edited so the changes always appear, or changed just for the day
- Showing tasks in either a randomized or the inputted order
- Buttons to remove from today's list, skip a task temporarily, or mark as completed
- Small confetti animation pops up with a motivational message when a task is completed
- Ability to add tasks throughout the day
- When the day is over, the program will display everything that was completed for the day and completed task count
- Keeps track of the task high-score

## Currently a work-in-progess
I'm currently the sole dev working on this, so the going is a bit slow lol I hope to have at least one major push a month,
as I am working a day job and studying on top of this project. Thank you for your patience! :)
